Every user can upload solutions to any challenge (even their own), but only the owner of a solution can edit or delete it. Only the solution and challenge owners can see the solution and the recieved feedback.

### Solution evaluator

Provides a way for challenge owners to check if a given _Solution_ is correct and evaluates all _Solutions_. Gives feedback on _Solutions_ (memory, cpu usage, which inputs produce incorrect outputs, etc.).

### Comment administration

Comments can be appended to _Challenges_ or _Solutions_. Comments have a creation date and an owner. They can be deleted or edited by the owner at any time.
